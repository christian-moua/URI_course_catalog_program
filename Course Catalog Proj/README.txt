About: Documentation regarding updates on the URI Course Catalog Parser Program.
Will hopefully clear up any confusion if picked up midway through and can be completed
by the next willing participant.  Objective of the URI Course Catalog Parser Program is
to find the specific years from the old written course catalog files from URI of when
course titles were changed for classes.  For example, if AFS 101 was titled "Intro. to
Farming" in 1981 but then in 1985 was changed to "Intro to Farming and Agriculture" the
parser would pick this up and write down the change to a spreadsheet or text file.
Should all be organized neatly and ideally in alphabetical order according to the class
and from there the year of the class is also taken into account regarding order.
